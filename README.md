# How to build/start/run project
## Before running the project
You must:
- install maven

## Running the Micronaut application
Simply run ```mvn clean install``` followed by ```mvn mn:run``` in the main directory

## Useful Maven commands
Generally when we running any of the commands below, we add the mvn clean step so that the target folder generated 
from the previous build is removed before running a newer build. This is how the command would look on integrating 
the clean step with install phase: mvn clean install

If we want to run a step in debug mode for more detailed build information and logs, we will add -X to the command.

### mvn clean
Cleans the project and removes all files generated by the previous build

### mvn compile
Compiles source code of the project

### mvn test-compile
Compiles the test source code

### mvn test
Runs tests for the project
